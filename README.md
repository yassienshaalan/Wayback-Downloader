## How to Use

### Step 1: Define the URLs

First, define the list of URLs that you want to download. You can specify these URLs in the `urls` list within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block in the `download.py` script. For example:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    urls = [
        'https://growingdata.com.au/online-learning-the-challenging-data-frontier/'
    ]
    directory = 'downloaded_articles'
    download_pages(urls, directory)
```

### Step 2: Run the Wayback Downloader
Once you've defined the URLs to download, follow these steps:
cd wayback-downloader

Navigate to the project directory:
python app.py
This will start the download process and retrieve the archived web pages from the Wayback Machine.

### Step 3: Access Downloaded HTML Files
The downloaded archived web pages will be saved as HTML files in the specified directory. In the provided example, the HTML files will be saved in the downloaded_articles directory.

You can now access and work with the downloaded HTML files for further analysis or processing.

Feel free to customize the urls list to match your specific requirements, and the Wayback Downloader will fetch the corresponding archived web pages.
